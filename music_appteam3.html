<h2>About</h2>
<p>SongStorm&#0153 is an application for the iPad whose goal is to make it simple and intuitive<br/>
for aspiring songwriters as well as professional composers to create a product that looks like<br/>
classic sheet music, but offers a stylish interface that is fun for everyone to use. Are you tired</br> 
of having to write notes with a pen or pencil onto a piece of paper with a staff? You do not have to</br>
look any further once you use this application because it offers a staff and notes as all composers are</br>
used to, and you do not have to draw out the notes everytime you want to add them to the staff. SongStorm</br>
has a number of features that make it a pleasure for any songwriter to use.</p>  
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>To make it easy for users to add notes to the staff, there are buttons from which you can choose the type</br>
of note you want to add. The choices include quarter notes, whole notes, half notes among others. Once you have</br>
selected the type of note you want to add, it is also very simple to set what pitch you want the note to have - C, D, E </br>
etc. Once a note is added to the staff and the pitch is selected, the app plays the pitch you have added so that you can hear</br>
how your composition would currently sound if it were to be played.</p> 
<h2>Developers</h2>
<p>There are three developers of this application - Jay Wang, Scott Jacobson and Eric Mariasis. Jay and Eric are both</br>
Computer Science majors at the Engineering School of Tufts University, and they have one year remaining until they</br>
receive their Bachelor of Science degree. Scott is currently a second-year student at Tufts and has taken a number of</br>
music classes in addition to the computer science classes he has taken.</p>
<h2>Development Challenges</h2>
<p>Our development team originally started out with four members, but one of the members had to leave the team due to medical</br>
issues. Because of that, it took the remaining team members some extra time to figure out how to divide the work in completing</br>
the application. Despite that shocking obstacle, we have been capable of building our app.</p>
